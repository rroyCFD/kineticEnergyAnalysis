### Description
The kineticEnergyAnalysis class performs a term-by-term kinetic energy calculation. Outputs the integral kinetic energy content for each term and  total balance at each time step. Writes out every term during OpenFOAM outputTime. Kinetic energy content from the difference of collocated pressure gradient and reconstructed staggared gradient is also produced.
